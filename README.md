# notes
Notes, tools, and artefacts from a constraint-driven sailing life.

## What this is

This is a collection of notes, diagrams, tools, and written artefacts produced while building and living a constrained, mobile life centred around a small sailboat.

The focus is not travel, content, or lifestyle optimisation, but practical systems, trade-offs, and reasoning under real limits: money, energy, tools, and attention.

## What appears here

Things are added when they exist and are useful.

That may include:
- technical notes and wiring diagrams
- small tools or scripts
- system designs and failure analyses
- short essays grounded in lived constraints

There is no schedule.
Long gaps are normal.
Silence usually means nothing interesting is ready.

## Artefacts

Nothing has been published here yet.

When artefacts do appear, they will remain available even if nothing new is added for a long time.
